They are made up of many perceptron neutrons. They are the primary unit that works together to form a perceptron layer. These neurons receive information in the set of inputs. You combine these numerical inputs with a bias and a group of weights, which then produces a single output. For computation, each neuron considers weights and bias. Then, the combination function uses the weight and the bias to give an output (modified input). It works through the following equation:combination = bias +weights * inputsAfter this, the activation function produces the output with the following equation:output = activation(combination)This function determines what kind of role the neural network performs. They form the layers of the network.So, How Does a Neural Network Work Exactly?Now that you know what is behind a neural network and how it works, we can focus on the working of a neural network. Here’s how it worksInformation is fed into the input layer which transfers it to the hidden layerThe interconnections between the two layers assign weights to each input randomlyA bias added to every input after weights are multiplied with them individuallyThe weighted sum is transferred to the activation functionThe activation function determines which nodes it should fire for feature extractionThe model applies an application function to the output layer to deliver the outputWeights are adjusted, and the output is back-propagated to minimize errorThe model uses a cost function to reduce the error rate. You will have to change the weights with different training models. The model compares the output with the original resultIt repeats the process to improve accuracyThe model adjusts the weights in every iteration to enhance the accuracy of the output. </p></div>
